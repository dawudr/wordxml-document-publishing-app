  <section title="Unit introduction" style="UnitAhead">
    <unitinbrief>&lt;p&gt;This unit covers how machining processes can be used to manufacture complicated shapes by the removal (cutting) of material.  This will involve the set-up and use of secondary processing machines to manufacture a component.&lt;/p&gt;</unitinbrief>
    <introduction>&lt;p&gt;Many of the products and components we use daily would not be available without secondary machining processes. The use of these processes to manufacture a product or component is sometimes easy to spot, like a machine bearing or the nut holding in place a brake shoe on a bicycle. For other products or components, like curtains, it is less easy to spot. This is because you need to first think about how the curtains have been manufactured. Hence, the curtains are manufactured using machines containing components that have been subjected to secondary machining processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a future engineer you will need to understand and acquire practical skills in a range of machining processes. The knowledge and practical skills are required to enable engineers to design feasible solutions to engineering problems. For example, a feasible solution is one that can be manufactured using secondary machining processes. This unit will prepare learners well for a mechanical or manufacturing engineering apprenticeship or degree course and for technician level role as a machine setter and setter-operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this unit you will cover the technology and characteristics of a range of traditional, such as turning, and specialist, such as broaching, machining processes. You will develop health and safety skills required to work on secondary machining processes and gain practical skills and understanding to set-up and operate traditional secondary machining processes to manufacture a component. Finally learners will reflect on their skills and understanding applied to and behaviours whilst manufacturing a prototype component.&lt;/p&gt;</introduction>

    <assessmentguidance>&lt;p&gt;Learning aim A: Understand the technology and characteristics of secondary machining processes that are widely used in industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For AP1:&lt;/b&gt; Learners will write a report that will include information about both traditional and specialist secondary machining processes. Different learners should cover different processes and choose different components to research.  It must demonstrate an understanding of how three traditional secondary machining processes are used to produce a range of features in components. It should include case studies of three different specialist processes that have been researched and will explain how these are used to produce features on three different components (one component per specialist process).  The report may have some inaccuracies relating to engineering terminology and the explanations may be difficult to understand in parts, however there will be a clear indication that three traditional and three specialist processes have been covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For AM1&lt;/b&gt;:  Additionally the learner will analyse how these different secondary machining processes are used. For example the report should highlight the required actions of the process to produce the features and accuracy required and should highlight the relationship between tool and workpiece movements for the different processes. The analysis will be consistent across all the processes covered and include details about energy consumption and disposal of fluids and waste material and the tolerances achievable. There will be few inaccuracies relating to engineering terminology and the explanations will be easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For AD1&lt;/b&gt;: The report will include a balanced evaluation of the secondary machining processes including energy consumption, disposal of fluids and waste material for different batch sizes. The report will use the correct technical engineering terms and be written using high quality language e.g. grammatically accurate.  The report will provide a balanced view of how each process will accommodate different tolerances and batch sizes and how this relates to sustainable manufacture of components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning aim B: Set-up traditional secondary processing machines safely to manufacture a component.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning aim C: Carry out traditional secondary machining processes to safely manufacture a component.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For BP2 and BP3&lt;/b&gt;: Learners will produce a risk assessment of two traditional machining processes and notes to show why health and safety requirements are needed.  The evidence produced from the practical activity will include a range of observation records and / or witness statements, complete with annotated photographs and drawings, and set up planning notes to show how the machining processes were set-up. For pass the majority of the speeds and feeds, tooling and work piece holding devices will be set up correctly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For BM2&lt;/b&gt;: The learner evidence will show how the correct tooling, work piece holding devices and use of speeds and feeds were used and selected as part of the practical activity involving at least two traditional machining processes. The evidence will take the form of observation records and / or witness statements, complete with annotated photographs and drawings. A risk assessment and written response will show how any mitigation actions from the risk assessment would be applied when setting up and machining the component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For CP4&lt;/b&gt;: The evidence will include a range of observation records and / or witness statements, complete with annotated photographs and drawings to show how the machining processes were used safely to manufacture a component, cutting fluid applied correctly (where relevant), swarf removed correctly, and the work piece removed from the machine safely.  The records will outline the actual machining processes undertaken to create the six features on the component and that it was free from burrs, sharp edges and false cuts. However, limited reference will be made to accuracy and the finished components may not be to the desired tolerance or surface texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For CM3&lt;/b&gt;: Additionally the evidence, such as observation records, will also show how accuracy was achieved on at least six features. The evidence will also include either an annotated drawing or a table of results to show what measurements were taken for each of the features and what adjustments were made to ensure dimensional and surface texture accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For BC.D2&lt;/b&gt;: The evidence, such as witness statements, will show how the set up and parameters, e.g. application of cutting fluid and tool feed rate, were refined during the machining to ensure the process continues to operate safely and produces a component that is accurate. The evidence will make reference to: the way the manufacture was carried out safely e.g. correct tooling overhang, appropriate secure fixing of the work piece, reference made to the risk assessment, and how the parameters can be used to control the:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;effectiveness e.g. optimising the order of tools and distance travelled by the tools and machining the component in a realistic time,  and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;efficiency, e.g. replacing worn tools, correct fluid use and of the machining processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence will also contain notes or similar that justifies how the risks identified, in the risk assessment, have been made less severe by changing/controlling actions/practices during the machining.  These notes will be understood by a third party who may or may not be an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning aim D: Review the processes used to machine a component and reflect on own performance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For DP5 and DP6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;A lessons learnt report, of no more than 1,000 words, will be presented covering the management of health and safety, the application of machining and general engineering skills and a reflection of personal performance. The report will explain what:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;actions were taken to manage health and safety in the workplace e.g. what personal protective equipment was used and whether any unforeseen issues occurred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;traditional secondary machining skills were used, such as how the intended surface texture was achieved, how dimensional accuracy was achieved and holes were centred accurately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;general engineering skills were used, such as understanding Cartesian coordinates and interpreting drawings, and recognising technical parts of machines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;personal characteristics were used, such as time management to ensure the activity was completed within the allotted time, listening to instructions from others to ensure some self reliance and integrity to own up to any mistakes or difficulties, respect other beliefs e.g. not using tallow (animal fat) as a cutting compound (fluid)..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For DM4&lt;/b&gt;: Additionally the evidence, such as the report, will explain what improvements can be made to the set up and use traditional secondary machining processes.  It will also explain the actions taken, the traditional secondary machining and general engineering skills, and personal characteristics that were considered as part of the reflection exercise and how health and safety was managed throughout.  Some parts of the evidence (report) may have more emphasis than others, creating an unbalanced viewpoint, and making it more difficult for a third party to understand and implement any improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For U.D3&lt;/b&gt;: The evidence, such as the report, will present a professional understanding of traditional secondary machining processes when giving facts, opinions and recommendations.  It will use concise written language that includes correct technical engineering terms and accurate grammar and will clearly differentiate facts from opinion.  The report will be easy to read and will be understood by a third party who may or may not be an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report will include a balanced view about the actions taken, traditional secondary machining and general engineering skills, and personal characteristics considered to make improvements to traditional secondary machining processes and the management of health and safety.  There will be clear links to improvements in effectiveness and consistency&lt;/p&gt;</assessmentguidance>
